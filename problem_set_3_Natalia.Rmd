Problem set 3: 
Structured population models 
Foundations of Quantitative Reasoning with Dr. Easton R. White 

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
# load packages 
library(tidyverse) 
library(popbio) # construction and analysis of matrix population models

plants <- load("~/Desktop/Quantitative_Reasoning/COMPADRE_v.4.0.1.RData")
# compadre$metadata$CommonName

animals <-load("~/Desktop/Quantitative_Reasoning/COMADRE_v.2.0.1.RData")
# comadre$metadata$CommonName

# to find strings text 
grep(comadre$metadata$CommonName, pattern = "Cabbage aphid") # three different entries
 
# all entries come from the same publication: "Feeding location affects demographic performance of cabbage aphids on winter canola" by Ximena Cibils-Stewart1, Brett K. Sandercock2 & Brian P. McCornack

# explore one entry 
comadre$metadata[821, ]

# explore matrices
comadre$mat[821][[1]] # there are four matrices: matA, matU, matF, and matC
```

a. What species (and location if available) did you choose? Why did you choose the species?

I chose to work with the Cabbage aphid from the U.S. because understanding its population dynamics would be ecologically and economically important. Additionally, I have previous experience raising aphids in laboratory conditions and have seen their populations rapidly increase or die over a short period of time under stable environmental conditions and this would be a great chance to explore the mechanisms behind those population changes. Especially because you can tease apart mating resources in populatin dynamics since aphdis clone themselves. Additionally, I though that Cabbage aphids are a good system to study predator-prey populations dynamics that I will be teaching soon in class and that are the base ecological models behind my research interests. 

b. What question do you want to answer about this population (e.g. population status, best management strategies)?

I am interested in understanding strategies to manage aphid population's rapid growth, thinking more in terms of biological control by predators than by inorganic pesticides. At which age stage is the cabbage aphid population growth more sensitive? Thinking about when an individual vulnerable to a predators (or to an organic insecticide) would be more effictive to control the population. 

c. Calculate eigenvalue, stable age distribution, elasticity, and sensitivity. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
aphids <- comadre$mat[821][[1]]$matA
print(aphids)

# using eigen function in base R that "Computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors of numeric or complex matrices."

# calculate eignvalue, or population growth, for matA
eigen_value <- eigen(aphids)
print(eigen_value)

# all eigen values
eigen_value$values

# extracting highest - or dominant - eigen value
eigen_value$values[1] 

# The dominant eigenvalue determines population growth
# 1.24, means this population of Cabbage aphids is exponentially growing

# all eigen vectors 
eigen_value$vectors # remembering that the number of columns are the number of age groups, so in this Cabbage aphid population there are 6 age groups which are as follows: four nymphal stages (1st-4th instars) and two adult stages (5th instar reproductive and post-reprodcutive).
```

![Cabbage aphid life cycle - from Cibilis-Stewart et al. 2015.](aphid_life_cycle.png)

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
# extract dominant eigenvector or stable age distribution
eigen_value$vectors[,1]

# calculate sensitivity with popbio package
eigen_sensitivity <- sensitivity(aphids)
which.max(eigen_sensitivity)

# calculate elasticity with popbio package
eigen_elasticity <- elasticity(aphids)
which.max(eigen_elasticity)
```

Ok. Now, what does this tell you about the population?

Sensitivity tells us how a change in a parameter will affect population growth. In this population of aphids, it seems like the most sensitive parameter is the transition from 1st instars to 2nd instars.And according to Cibils-Stewart et al definition: "Elasticities measure the effect of a proportional change in a matrix element on k and enable direct comparisons of demographic rates between survival (bounded between 0 and 1) and fecundity (bounded between 0 and infinity) among the treatments." So, based on the elasticity we know that the 5th instars, or reproductive adults, have a greater impact to population growth, as expected. 

Do we get the same proportional change if we tweak the sensitivity?

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
# modified form Brendan Case
m <- aphids

my_func = function(i, j, L) {
   old = eigen(L)[[1]][1]
   L[i, j] = L[i, j] + .05
   print(str_glue("changed: ", i, ", ", j, " difference in eigenval: ", eigen(L)[[1]][1] - old))
}

cross2(1:nrow(m), 1:ncol(m)) %>%
   transpose() %>%
   pwalk(my_func, L = m)
```

YES! The results stay the same. A change in a 1st instars will potentially affect more this population of cabbage aphids. 

Do we get the same proportional change if we tweak the elasticity?

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
# modified from Brendan Case
m <- aphids

my_func = function(i, j, L) {
   old = eigen(L)[[1]][1]
   L[i, j] = L[i, j] * 1.05
   print(str_glue("changed: ", i, ", ", j, " difference in eigenval: ", eigen(L)[[1]][1] - old))
}

cross2(1:nrow(m), 1:ncol(m)) %>%
   transpose() %>%
   pwalk(my_func, L = m)
```

... and YES! We obtain the same result as above. The proportional change at the reproductive stage (5th instar) will affect more the population growth model of cabbage aphids. 

d. Using the calculations in part (c), or additional calculations, address the question you proposed in part (b).

To manage this population of cabbage aphids, we know that we can have a big impact in the population by targeting the survival of 1st instars. However, from the elasticity analysis we find support to decrease proportionally the population growth by targeting 5th instars (reproductive adults).
